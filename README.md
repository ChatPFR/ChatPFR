# ChatPFR (Chat Punk Fucking Rock): AI Built By the People, For the People

ChatPFR is an open-source project aimed at creating a distributed file system AI that utilizes idle CPU and GPU clock cycles from donors' and end user's personal computers for it's training, learning, and date processing. Our goal is to create a decentralized AI system that can not be controlled or manipulated by a single company or government, putting the power of AI in the hands of the people.

## The Prompt That Started It All

"I want to create software that users could install on their computers and allow idle cpu and gpu clock cycles to be used by a distributed file system that could support an open source version of ChatGPT-4. An AI for the people hosted and supported by the people. Because AI being controlled just by monopolies with billions of dollars is dangerous. The only way for an open source AI to be possible is to decentralize it like a block chain.

How would you go about making this happen?" - Josh Hutson, 2023

## Objectives

1. **Decentralized AI processing**: Develop a system that leverages idle CPU and GPU resources from a network of volunteer computers to create a distributed AI processing platform.

2. **Distributed file system**: Implement a distributed file system to store and manage data across the network of participating computers, ensuring data redundancy and availability.

3. **Resource allocation and management**: Design and implement algorithms for efficient allocation and management of processing resources within the network, taking into account factors such as latency, reliability, and load balancing.

4. **User Interface and Experience**: Create an easy-to-use, intuitive user interface that allows users to contribute resources, access the AI's capabilities, and monitor the system's performance.

5. **Privacy and Security**: Ensure that user data is protected and secure, implementing encryption and other security measures to prevent unauthorized access and maintain privacy.

6. **Community-driven development**: Encourage contributions from the AI and open-source communities, fostering a collaborative environment that drives the project's growth and improvement.

7. **Documentation and Tutorials**: Provide comprehensive documentation and tutorials to help users understand, set up, and use ChatPFR effectively.

8. **Scalability and Performance**: Ensure that ChatPFR is designed to scale as the network grows, maintaining high performance and efficiency.

By defining these objectives, we aim to provide a clear direction for the development of ChatPFR and guide our efforts in creating a powerful, decentralized AI system that benefits everyone. With the help of the AI and open-source communities, we can make ChatPFR a reality.
