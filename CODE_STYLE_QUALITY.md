# ChatPFR Code Style and Quality Guidelines

Thank you for contributing to the ChatPFR project! To ensure consistency and maintainability across the codebase, please adhere to the following code style and quality guidelines.

## Languages and Frameworks

The ChatPFR project uses the following languages and frameworks:

- Python: For back-end development, including the distributed storage and communication components.
- JavaScript: For front-end development, mainly using the React framework.
- React: For building the user interface.
- IPFS: For distributed storage and file sharing.
- Signal Protocol: For secure end-to-end encryption.

## Code Style

1. **Python**: Follow the [PEP 8 Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) as the code formatter.

2. **JavaScript**: Follow the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) and use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) as the code formatter.

3. **React**: Follow the [Airbnb React/JSX Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react) and use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) as the code formatter.

## Code Quality

1. **Linting**: Use [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) for Python and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for JavaScript to ensure code quality and catch potential issues.

2. **Testing**: Write unit tests using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) for Python and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for JavaScript. Aim for a high level of code coverage, and make sure your tests pass before submitting a pull request.

3. **Documentation**: Document your code with clear comments and docstrings. Update the project's README and other relevant documentation when introducing new features or making changes to existing functionality.

4. **Security**: Keep security in mind when writing your code. Follow best practices for secure coding, and use tools like [Bandit](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit) for Python and [npm audit](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-audit) for JavaScript to check for potential security vulnerabilities.

## Recommended Development Tools

To ensure compatibility and consistency across the project, we recommend using the following tools for development:

- Code Editor: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Version Control: [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Python Environment Management: [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)

By adhering to these code style and quality guidelines, you'll help maintain a consistent and high-quality codebase for the ChatPFR project. Thank you for your contributions!
